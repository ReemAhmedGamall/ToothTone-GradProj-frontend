## 🚀 Features

### Front-End Development
- **Structure & Styling:** HTML and CSS with modern layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid for responsive pages.
- **Component Management:** React’s component-based architecture for reusable code and easy scaling. JSX combines HTML-like syntax with JavaScript.
- **State Handling:** React Hooks manage state and side-effects, improving clarity and reducing complexity.
- **Performance Enhancements:** Server-side rendering applied where needed to improve SEO and reduce load time.

### 🦷 Periodontal Chart Design
- **Hybrid Rendering:** Built using **Canvas** (high-performance rendering) + **SVG** (interactive, scalable elements).
- **Interactive Features:** Labels, selections, and other chart interactions designed for usability and clarity.
- **Optimized UI:** Efficient rendering even with complex dental data.
