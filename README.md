## üé® Frontend Overview
The **Frontend** is built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React** to create a clean, modular, and responsive user interface.

### Structure & Styling
- HTML + CSS with Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts.
- React component-based architecture with JSX for seamless UI logic.
- React Hooks for state and side-effect management.
- Server-side rendering applied where needed for SEO and performance.

### Periodontal Chart
- Built with **Canvas** (for high-performance rendering) and **SVG** (for interactive labels and selections).
- Efficient rendering with clear, scalable visuals.

## üóÇÔ∏è Backend Overview
The **Backend** is built using **ASP.NET Web API (C#)** with **Entity Framework Core** to manage all clinical data and system logic.

### Architecture
- Controllers handle logic and API requests.
- Models represent data entities.
- SQL Server stores structured clinical and user data.
- RESTful APIs are stateless, making the backend easier to scale.
- Database indexing improves response times for frequent queries.
- Swagger is integrated for API testing and live documentation.

### Real-Time Speech Recognition
- WebSocket support for hands-free dental charting.
- Fine-tuned Whisper Small model transcribes voice input into structured JSON.
- React UI reads JSON and updates the periodontal chart instantly.
